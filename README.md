## INTRODUCTION
Your project manager says you have to redesign an old website and wants to adopt a modern approach to building the site. Your mission is to propose and stand for a technology to implement web interfaces and to defend it against the others. 

### The technologies / Groups

1. Javi B. - dani Z. / BULMA 
2. Mateu - Samu / CSS GRID & FLEXBOX
3. Dani F. - Sebas - Carlos / BOOTSTRAP
3. Jose - Chema / MATERIAL DESIGN
5. Dani A. - Alberto / TAILWIND CSS

## WHAT TO DO?

You'll have to create a website example using the technology and a Google Docs Presentation and optionally, deploy the website.

### 1. A simple web page 

- Create the front page of [this webpage](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_website_band.htm#band) with the Framework assigned to the Team.
- The site will have to follow the instructions [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZQ64qEARAcRYk9TDjlfnI6lt_QjAU4DblGibuAwuQVE/edit#)

### 2. Google Docs Presentation

- Create a video presentation of 5 to 10 minutes
- Every member of a team will record a part of the video separately using a video recording software
- Using a video edition software, append the videos into one file and embed it in the `about` section of the webpage

- In the presentation, you're going to defend your technology against the others. 
- You should talk about:
    - Installation
    - Available documentation / community
    - Main features: Responsiveness, Grid System, theming, integration with other tools/frameworks ....
    - Performance
    - Integration with front frameworks (vue.js, react.js, angular.js, etc)

- You shoud always keep in mind that you must compare your technology with the others. Ask the other groups info about their technology!

### 3. (Optional) Deploy the website

Deploy the website with **Netlify** or similar tools.
